## About

ClipMorph is an AI-powered stylization tool to morph your clips into a 
different style. It offers a wide range of pre-trained styles to choose from,
or new styles can be effortlessly added by training a new model in under 
one hour. Built on state-of-the-art image-to-image AI models, ClipMorph can 
stylize videos in real-time (~25-30 frames per second).

The team behind ClipMorph is composed of:
- [Sacha Lewin](https://github.com/iSach)
- [Axelle Schyns](https://github.com/AxelleSchyns)
- [Laurie Boveroux](https://github.com/LaurieBvrx)
- [Arthur Louette](https://github.com/LouetteArthur)
